# Exploring Data from a Consumer Prices Survey

In this project, I used Excel and SQL to analyze data from a Survery of Consumer Prices taken in 2009-2016. This project contains **1162844** records of data across 13 columns.

## üßº Data cleaning
The data was retrieved from as a .csv file from Jamaica's open data [website.](https://data.gov.jm/dataset/consumer-prices/resource/9eddc57f-c00a-4d3a-bf09-6aa59f1f7afa) A lot of cleaning was needed. I had to trim whitespace from each column, remove blank and duplicate cells, and clean strings in columns D & E in Excel. 
<br> There was also a problem with some of the dates. I used SQL to update the faulty dates and correct faulty codes.


## ‚ùì Queries
I performed 8 queries, whose results I included in the comments. <br>

One of the queries created a table of available items at supermarkets in the city of Montego Bay, a snippet of which I've shown below:

## üí¨ Reflection
I enjoyed doing this project. It has helped me to develop my tenacity and I've learnt so much that I look forward to using in the real world. Please feel free to share your thoughts and any suggestions to my code.
